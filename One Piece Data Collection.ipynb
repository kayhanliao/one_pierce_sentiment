Sanji saved a marine as well. Nice of him. And the G5 guys already consider him their 'bro'. More allies for the Strawhats perhaps?\\n\\n3.) It's really hard to tell what DoFla is planning. I am going to wait for the Mangastream translation. Does he really tell Vergo to kill Caesar, *because* Caesar is the only one who knows how to produce SAD? That... doesn't seem to make any sense.\\n\\n4.) Really confused why DoFla seems so confident in Vergo (this is right after he fought Sanji to a draw).\\n\\n5.) So he is going to send the woman that attacked him and Buffalo (perhaps the big guy).\\n\\n6.) Also, shouldn't Monet be busy fighting Luffy instead of chatting on the phone?\\n\\n7.) So many questions about the Dragons - weren't they always called 'Vegapunk's' dragons? And it is said that they were artificially created - maybe from humans? That would be pretty dark. Man, Luffy and them even ate the big one. Doesn't look like the Dragon is dead though, nothing that Chopper couldn't fix, so even if he is Monomosuke, he should be fine.\\n\\nFinally - what is SAD? We know that there are SAD 'tankers' going between Dress Rosa (where DoFla is now) and Punk Hazard. Re-read Chapter 672, where Vergo makes his first appearance. So it seems to be a liquid, or perhaps a gas. But why is it so important to the order of the New World and even to DoFla himself?\",\n",

The shadowy top-hat character looks as if it's pupils have animal characteristics, as well as his arms having metal characteristics. What was that little girl in the group eating? What's all this talk about vessels? DD's reminding me of a combination between Greed and Frank Booth. So many mysteries.\\n\\nWouldn't be surprised honestly if this Arc ends in the next 10 chapters. We've now got the orders for the baddies to retreat to home base, as well as direct orders to kill Ceaser from the guy pulling the strings(rimshot), leaving really just rescuing the children and Law/SAD the only to things left to settle. I'm still curious if we're going to see the Yeti Cool Brothers again also since their faces were shadowed out, or if they're so minor in that the joke was nobody has ever seen their face and it's kept that way.\\n\\nAlso, as for the coverstory, lots have been suspecting Caribou to be working for DD/Joker(kidnapping mermaids, theft. etc), but here we have him about to be tied up by G-5. I suppose Yarisugi could just be a asshole marine and not be affiliated with Joker at all.\\n\\nAnd gah, two week wait, had a itching feeling it was going to go down this week, such a consistency of chapters in a row was starting to feel too good to be true.
